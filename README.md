## Hi there 👋

At work they call me *GitHub Evangelist* and am mainly focused on GitHub Partnership.

I am happy to help with any GitHub - related topics:
- 🆕 onboarding
- 👨🏻‍⚕️ governance
- ✈️ migration
- 🤖 GH Copilot and more..

> We migrated hundreds of repositories to GitHub and used native tools and our build tools to address complex scenarios, such as large repositories, LFS, and missing refs.

I am a DevOps Engineer with a developer background. I love to know how the systems in which my code is running operate. I am most interested in backend solutions.

Developer of business solutions. I have always been interested in migration projects and integrating various systems.

Knowledge about maintaining a production environment. Good understanding of infrastructure, with the ability to support hardware and software solutions used to run developed products.

As a developer, I am experienced in  C#, TypeScript, and JAVA.
As a DevOps, I am experienced in the cloud (Azure, AWS) and on prem-solutions.
