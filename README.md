## Hi there 👋

At work they call me *GitHub Evangelist* and am mainly focused on GitHub Partnership.

I am happy to help with any GitHub - related topics:
- 🆕 **Onboarding**: Assisting organisations with getting started on GitHub and understanding its features.
- 👨🏻‍⚕️ **Governance**: Implementing governance policies and best practices for managing GitHub.
- ✈️ **Migration**: Supporting and providing migration services to GitHub from other platforms.
- 🤖 **GH Copilot** and more: Providing workshops for using GitHub Copilot and other GitHub tools effectively.

⚠️ Warning wall of text below... ⚠️

I’m a DevOps Engineer with a developer background, and I’ve got a real passion for understanding how the systems behind my code work. My main interest lies in backend solutions, where I feel I can make the most impact.

Throughout my journey in the IT world, I've worn many hats — team lead, project manager, developer, full-stack, game developer, DevOps, and more. I've dabbled in disaster recovery, site reliability, and even tackled PCI-DSS compliance. Whether in startups or big corporations, I’ve seen it all and picked up valuable lessons along the way — especially how to dodge some of the common pitfalls!

What really drives me is developing business solutions and diving into migration projects or system integrations. I’ve got a solid grasp of how to maintain a production environment and a good understanding of infrastructure, so I can support the hardware and software that keeps everything ticking.

On the coding side, I’m comfortable with C#, TypeScript, and Java. And when it comes to DevOps, I have experience with both cloud-based and on-prem solutions. I love turning complex challenges into smooth, efficient workflows and helping teams thrive!
